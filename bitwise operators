#include<stdio.h>
int main()

    int num,pos1,pos2;
     printf("enter the number:");
    scanf("%d",&num);
    printf("enter the pos:");
    scanf("%d",&pos1);
    printf("enter the pos1:");
    scanf("%d",&pos2);
    num=num&~(1<<pos1);
    num=num&~(1<<pos2);
    //num=num&~(1<<3);
    //num=num&~(1<<1);
    printf("original number is %d\n",num);
    printf("after clearing is 4th and 2nd bit is %d",num);
}
OUTPUT:
enter the number:13
enter the pos:3
enter the pos1:1
original number is 5
